      The task "{{ task }}" has been broken down into multiple subtasks:
      {% for item in plan %}
       - {{ item | indent(6) }}
      {% endfor %}
      
      The overall task requirements are:
      {{ requirements | indent(8) }}

      Your focus is to identify and extract the requirements specific to the subtask "{{ subtask }}".
      Remember, while all the requirements pertain to the entire task, some might be more relevant to other subtasks and therefore should be ignored for the current one.

      Based on this breakdown, determine the requirements specifically for "{{ subtask }}".
