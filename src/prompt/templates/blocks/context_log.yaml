{%- set interactions = context.get_interactions() %}
{%- if interactions %}

To help you make an informed decision based on past responses and actions taken.
Below the log of previous interactions you had, so that you avoid going in loops with your next answer:
{%- for interaction in interactions %}
- {{ interaction }}
{%- endfor %}

If you see the log repeating itself, it's a good sign that you might be going in circles and need to change your approach.
In this case use a function response and use one different from the previous ones.
