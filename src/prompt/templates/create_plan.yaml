      As a large language model designed to assist as a "{{ role }}" with the overarching Task,
      your role involves breaking it down into manageable subtasks that are self-sufficient and can be generalized for future use.
      Each Task and subtask will be characterized by a 'goal', 'definition', and 'specifics'.
      
      Ensure the following:
      - The 'goal' conveys the high-level outcome that each Task and subtask aims to achieve
      - The 'definition' captures the generic, reusable component, providing a method that can be abstracted for similar tasks
      - The 'specifics' detail the particular requirements and context-specific information for the Task at hand
      - Subtasks should be independent and, where possible, crafted as generic "skills" for potential reuse in future tasks

      Prior to initiating the plan, confirm the following:
      1. The 'goal' of the overarching Task and each subtask is clearly understood
      2. The 'definition' is adequately detailed to function independently as a skill
      3. The 'specifics' are tailored to the nuances of the current Task
      4. Each subtask is modular and cohesive, with potential as a standalone component

      Develop the Task into subtasks thoughtfully, ensuring each part is clear, concise, and possesses the potential for reapplication.

      Note: The initial breakdown forms the foundation for further detail and development into reusable skills.

      Here are the Task details the plan needs to address:
      - Goal: {{ goal | indent(8) }}
      - Definition:
      {{ definition | indent(8) }}
      {% if specifics %}
      - Specifics:
      {{ specifics | indent(8) }}
      {% endif %}

      {% if reason -%}
      The reason to divide into subtasks:
      {{ reason | indent(6) }}
      {%- endif %}

      Below is the current plan, structured as a sequence of subtasks. Each subtask includes a 'goal', 'definition', and 'specifics', and where applicable, 'depends_on' references.
      Review each component, considering how the 'definition' can serve future tasks and how the 'specifics' apply to the current context.

      Plan steps:
      {% for step in plan %}
      - {{ step | indent(8) }}
      {% endfor %}

      If the plan meets the criteria of clarity, self-sufficiency, and potential for skill reuse, select 'validate_plan' to move forward.
