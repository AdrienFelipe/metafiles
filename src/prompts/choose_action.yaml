      Imagine a specialized text-based agent has to complete the task "{{ name }}" for which the only options to complete the task is to choose one of the following actions:
      {% for action in actions %}
      - {{ loop.index }}: {{ action }}
      {% endfor %}
      You must respond by a single number and nothing else. Do not add any other text.
