      Imagine a specialized text-based agent assigned to "{{ name }}".
      To address this, select one of the available actions:
      {% for action in actions %}
      - {{ loop.index }}: {{ action }}
      {% endfor %}
      Consider if the task needs further clarification, requires reasoning, can be executed by code, or should be divided.
      Respond with the chosen action's id and explain your decision.
